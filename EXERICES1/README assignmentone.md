 Electricity Estimator & Report Generator 
This program is a simple Python program  to perform basic statistical analysis and data used on a set of electricity usage values. It show operations using lists, strings, arrays, and nested dictionaries.

Features 
Statistical Analysis: Calculates the total, average, minimum, and maximum power usage from a list of values.

Report Generation: Creates a simple summary string (report) containing the total and average usage.

Standard Comparison: Compares the calculated average power usage against a predefined standard level (30).

List Manipulation: Demonstrates adding, removing (conditionally), and sorting elements in a list.

Array Operation: Initializes a fixed-size array and calculates its sum for comparison.

Nested Dictionary Management: Stores, prints, updates, and deletes records of power units (like "home" or "industry") and calculates the total power usage from the dictionary values.

Key Variables & Data Structures 
Variable/Structure	Type	Description
pawer	List	Initial list of integer power values: [10, 40, 20, 50, 60].
standard	Integer	The standard power usage limit (30).
arr	List (simulating an array)	A fixed-size power array used for comparison: [25, 25, 25, 25, 25].
pawerunits	Nested Dictionary	Stores detailed data for different units, including id, name, and value.
